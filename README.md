Swarm Hack 2023 Project - Winner:

We developed autonomous control software for Pi-Pick robots to work collaboratively and play a game of football with a student team of 4 people. 
The project span 24 hours across 2 days and was my first real introduction to robotics.

The task was to write python code that would allow 3 robots to act as a team consisting of an attacker, midfielder and defender to work together
and win a game of football against another teams robot.

We were given a custom control middle ware language similar to ROS2 and had to come up with our own strategy. 
Given the lack of experience in the team I suggested we use swarm robotics.
Our winning strategy took inspiration from swarm robotics relying on simple rules and constraints based on what the robots can sense using LiDAR
for adaptive position between the 3 positions.

This method was simpler and we won consistently against all the other teams who had more advanced solutions.
